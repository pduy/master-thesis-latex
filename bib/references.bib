A current trend in processing image data is the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that have consistently beat competition in most benchmark data sets. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of transferring knowledge between CNNs when processing RGB-D data with the goal of both improving accuracy and reducing training time. We present experiments that show that our proposed approach can achieve both these goals.",
