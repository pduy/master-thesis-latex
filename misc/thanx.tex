\noindent This dissertation originated in a research project in the Neural Information
Processing Group (NI) in TU Berlin.

\noindent 
First of all I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Klaus Obermayer, head of the NI Group, for
giving me the opportunity to participate in a state of the art research in Deep Learning,
and for the knowledge that he gave in the courses Machine Intelligence 1 and 2, which
provided me the necessary background for the thesis.
\\ 
\\
Special thanks to Mr. Youssef Kashef for being my personal and direct supervisor. The time
working with him was full of pleasure. Mr. Kashef was very helpful in redirecting the
project when the results were not adequate and in raising good critical questions when
the outcomes got better. He also spent effort on proofreading my thesis and gave valuable
comments.
\\
\\ 
Many thanks to my group mates, Rodrigo Parra and Zitong Lian, for sharing the working
spirit, both technically and mentally. Although our topics are somewhat different, it is
still much easier for me to have partners going along in the same direction.
\\ 
\\
Furthermore I would like to thank all the people in the NI Group that I had a chance to
meet and discuss Machine Learning topics in the common student room. Some of those
conversations were very useful for my thesis.
